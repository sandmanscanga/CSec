# Guided - Separate (Apache, PHP, & MySQL)

---

## Reference

I am following a guide that can be found at [this link](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/dockerized-php-apache-and-mysql-container-development-environment/) to explore a possible solution for containerizing Apache, PHP, and MySQL.

## Prologue

This is a separate example and does not apply to the DVWA application for the main focus of the project, but might apply to my idea once it is understood.  The guide will cover the following key topics:

+ Setup and run a local PHP Apache server instance.

+ Serve a dynamic PHP-driven website.

+ Setup a MySQL database to run SQL scripts, fetch records, and print them in a PHP-driven website.
