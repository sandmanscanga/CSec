# CSec

A massive project to orchestrate the automation of a large docker network for spinning up intentionally vulnerable services and an attacking machine that automates various exploits in succession.  Can be used for quick exploit references, designing specific variations of a vulnerable to tweak existing exploits, and showcasing a live demonstration of preconfigured exploitation techniques.
