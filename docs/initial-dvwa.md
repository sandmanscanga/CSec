# Initial DVWA Application

A very basic implementation id the DVWA application has been implemented using Docker and the next focus will be to analyze any credentials that were exposed during the deployment process.  So far, I have used some default credentials that DBWA expects.  Moving forward, I would like to identify any credentials for any application using a centralized service.
